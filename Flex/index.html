      <p>Whispers</p>Following on from the first consultation meeting, I'd like to make you all aware that the proposal put forward by the business has changed slightly - please see the bullet points below. We all asked lots of questions, most of which had to be taken away and I shall keep you updated as and when I get more information. If you wish to discuss the matter with me or have any questions you would like to put forward, either message/email me directly or book some time in my calendar. I know some people believe this change is going to happen regardless of the consultation period, however, HR assured us that this is currently just a proposal, and they have already taken the feedback we gave them last time on board and made relevant changes.
